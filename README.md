# Project Jane: An AI Companion

A personal journey to build a voice-interactive AI companion named Jane—using Python, Linux, and Raspberry Pi. Designed to evolve, learn, and live alongside the user.

## 🌱 Current Focus
- Learning Python (using "Automate the Boring Stuff")
- Setting up and securing Raspberry Pi OS
- Creating a basic voice-interactive chatbot
- Exploring memory and automation features

## 🧪 The Goal
Jane isn't just a tool—she’s a companion. The goal is to create something that can observe, learn, interact naturally, and evolve. This repo will document that journey from zero to self-learning AI.
